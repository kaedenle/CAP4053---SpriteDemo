      words: '"I need your help. My financial situation is getting worse every day.
        I have debts that I can''t pay off and my business is not doing as well as
        it used to.'
    - speaker: 16
      words: I understand, Antonio. Let's take a look at your accounts and see what
        we can do to get you back on track.
    - speaker: 10
      words: It's not just the debts. I have to pay off Patrick. He's been pressuring
        me to settle our business dispute, and he's not backing down.
    - speaker: 16
      words: I see. And how much is he shaking you down for?
    - speaker: 10
      words: It's not just the money. He's been threatening me, saying that he'll
        ruin my reputation and my business if I don't comply.
    - speaker: 10
      words: I don't know what to do.
    - speaker: 16
      words: 'Hmm, this is a delicate situation. You can''t let him intimidate you,
        Antonio. But you also can''t just give in to his demands. '
    - speaker: 16
      words: Maybe it's time to consider other options.
    - speaker: 10
      words: '"Like what? I can''t just come up with a large sum of money out of
        nowhere.'
    - speaker: 16
      words: Well, there are ways to make it happen. You could liquidate some of
        your assets or take out a loan. But you have to be careful, Antonio.
    - speaker: 10
      words: I know, I know. But I have to do something. I can't keep living like
        this.
    - speaker: 16
      words: I understand. Let's work on a plan together, and we'll figure this out.
    - speaker: 16
      words: 'But in the meantime, I suggest you stay away from Patrick Blanchard. '
    - speaker: 16
      words: The last thing you need is to get involved in a dispute with him.

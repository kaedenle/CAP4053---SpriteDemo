  - dialogue:
    - speaker: 10
      words: I need your help, man. My financial situation is getting worse every
        day. I have debts that I can't pay off and our business is not doing as well
        as it used to.
    - speaker: 16
      words: I understand, Antonio. Let's take a look at your accounts and see what
        we can do to get you back on track.
    - speaker: 10
      words: It's not just the debts. I have to pay off Patrick. He's been pressuring
        me to settle our business dispute, and he's not backing down.
    - speaker: 16
      words: I see. So, how much is he shaking you down for?
    - speaker: 10
      words: It's not just the money. He's been threatening me, saying that he'll
        ruin my reputation if I don't comply.
    - speaker: 10
      words: I don't know what to do.
    - speaker: 16
      words: 'Hmm, this is a delicate situation. You can''t let him intimidate you,
        Antonio. But you also can''t just give in to his demands. '
    - speaker: 16
      words: Maybe it's time to consider other options.
    - speaker: 10
      words: Like what? I can't just come up with a large sum of money out of nowhere.
    - speaker: 16
      words: Well, there are ways to make it happen. You could liquidate some of
        your assets or take out a loan. But you have to be careful, Antonio.
    - speaker: 10
      words: I know, I know. But I have to do something. I just can't keep living
        like this.
    - speaker: 16
      words: I understand. Let's work on a plan together, and we'll figure this out.
    - speaker: 16
      words: 'But in the meantime, I suggest you stay away from Patrick Blanchard. '
    - speaker: 16
      words: The last thing you need is to get involved in a dispute with him.
  - dialogue:
    - speaker: 10
      words: I've been keeping a close eye on Patrick's business dealings lately,
        and I've noticed he's been making some risky investments.
    - speaker: 15
      words: Risky how?
    - speaker: 10
      words: He's been putting a lot of money into this new venture of his, and it's
        not looking good.
    - speaker: 10
      words: I think it's only a matter of time before he goes under.
    - speaker: 15
      words: And what does that have to do with us?
    - speaker: 10
      words: Don't you see? He's been trying to cut me out! If we take action now,
        while he's weak, we can take advantage. It's the perfect opportunity!
    - speaker: 18
      words: But don't you think that's a bit, rash? I mean, you guys have known
        each other for decades.
    - speaker: 15
      words: I know, but business is business. And let's be real, if he goes down,
        it's not like anyone is going to shed a tear. In fact, it might just make
        things easier for us.
  - dialogue:
    - speaker: 10
      words: You know, I've been thinking a lot about Patrick lately.
    - speaker: 18
      words: Why's that?
    - speaker: 10
      words: Well, let's just say I know some things about his personal life that
        could be very damaging if they got out.
    - speaker: 18
      words: Oh really? Like what?
    - speaker: 10
      words: Like, how he's been cheating on his wife with some young thing from
        his office.
    - speaker: 18
      words: Wow! And you think you could use that against him somehow?
    - speaker: 10
      words: I'm not sure yet. But it's good to have something to hold over his head,
        just in case.
    - speaker: 18
      words: I see. So, what are you going to do?
    - speaker: 10
      words: For now, I'm just going to sit on this information. But who knows what
        the future holds?
  - dialogue:
    - speaker: 10
      words: I just don't get it. Patrick acts like he's better than me. He thinks
        he's smarter, richer, more successful. The list goes on!
    - speaker: 10
      words: ' It''s like he enjoys holding it over me.'
    - speaker: 17
      words: Is that really how you see it?
    - speaker: 10
      words: 'Of course! He''s always rubbing his success in my face. '
    - speaker: 10
      words: He's had everything handed to him on a silver platter, while I've had
        to struggle for every penny.
    - speaker: 17
      words: But you've done pretty well for yourself, don't you think?
    - speaker: 10
      words: It's not enough. I want what he has.
    - speaker: 10
      words: I want to show everyone that I'm just as good as he is, if not better.
    - speaker: 17
      words: Well, what are you gonna do about it?
    - speaker: 10
      words: I don't know yet. But I'm not going to let him get away with treating
        me like crap.
    - speaker: 10
      words: He'll see that I'm not to be messed with.
  - dialogue:
    - speaker: 10
      words: I don't know, Patrick. This job makes me nervous. I don't want to get
        caught.
    - speaker: 13
      words: Oh, for god's sake, Antonio. Stop being such a coward. This job is nothing
        compared to what I've done in the past.
    - speaker: 13
      words: I understand that, but it's still risky. What if something goes wrong?
    - speaker: 13
      words: Relax, Antonio. You worry too much.
    - speaker: 10
      words: Well what about the money? What if we don't make as much as we thought
        we would?
    - speaker: 13
      words: Jesus Christ, Antonio! Would you stop worrying about the money? I've
        already taken care of that.
    - speaker: 13
      words: Just do your part and everything will work out fine. Same as always.
  - dialogue:
    - speaker: 13
      words: What the hell happened out there, Antonio? You screwed up the whole
        deal!
    - speaker: 10
      words: Don't you dare blame this all on me, Patrick! You were the one who insisted
        on cutting corners and rushing the job.
    - speaker: 13
      words: That's bull and you know it! I trusted you to handle this and you let
        me down.
    - speaker: 10
      words: And I trusted you to give me the resources I needed, but, instead, you
        cut costs and put us all at risk!
    - speaker: 13
      words: You're just trying to cover your own ass now. You know damn well this
        is all your fault!
    - speaker: 10
      words: No! You're just too blind to see the consequences of your actions!
    - speaker: 10
      words: I did everything I could to salvage the situation, but you made it impossible!
    - speaker: 13
      words: Go home, Antonio! I'm not discussing this any further tonight. Come
        to my office tomorrow morning and we'll discuss your future at this company.
  - dialogue:
    - speaker: 10
      words: Oh god! Oh, god! What have I done?!
    - speaker: 15
      words: Jesus, would you calm down? This won't be a problem.
    - speaker: 10
      words: The hell do you mean 'this won't be a problem'?! His death! It's all
        over the news!
    - speaker: 15
      words: Relax. We covered our tracks. Just keep a low profile and let me handle
        things.
    - speaker: 10
      words: And how do you think you're gonna handle things, huh?! This is bad!
        God, this is so bad!
    - speaker: 10
      words: 'What about the business? What about the project we were working on
        together? How am I supposed to move forward without him?! '
    - speaker: 15
      words: You'll manage. Just stay focused, and let me handle everything else.
        You know I've got your back.
    - speaker: 10
      words: I don't know, man. I feel like I'm losing it. I never wanted it to end
        up like this.

      words: Hey.
    - speaker: 0
      words: What? Who said that?
    - speaker: 7
      words: Its me... again, your conscious.
    - speaker: 0
      words: Why are you talking to me now? Antonio could come through that door
        right now!
    - speaker: 7
      words: I'll be quick. You just got another weapon and I want to teach you how
        to use it.
    - speaker: 7
      words: The gun is a ranged weapon with 2 attacks.
    - speaker: 7
      words: Attack 1 allows you to run and shoot. It also combos out of alot of
        things!
    - speaker: 7
      words: Attack2 is a shoulder bash that knocks enemies away.
    - speaker: 7
      words: If you hit Attack2 very late it doesn't knock back as far, but it allows
        for combos out of the bat.
    - speaker: 7
      words: A basic thing you can do is Attack2 > Attack1. Try it in the alley way
        when you get out of here, I think there's an enemy there.
    - speaker: 0
      words: It's a miracle I'm not dead yet with how much you've been talking.
    - speaker: 7
      words: Alright I'll leave you alone now, good luck!

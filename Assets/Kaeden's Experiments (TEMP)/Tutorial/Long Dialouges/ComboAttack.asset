    - speaker: 7
      words: Simple one hit strikes won't do against enemies in the next transfer.
    - speaker: 7
      words: You can chain certain moves together when you hit an enemy. The basic
        idea is to chain quicker attacks into heavy hitting attacks.
    - speaker: 7
      words: This is called "chaining". It'll allow you to output more damage against
        enemy hordes.
    - speaker: 7
      words: 'Use ''%Hit2%'' then ''%Hit1%'' in quick succession on that dummy behind
        you to try it out. '
    - speaker: 7
      words: You'll notice you'll be able to attack much faster compared to doing
        the same sequence when hitting nothing.

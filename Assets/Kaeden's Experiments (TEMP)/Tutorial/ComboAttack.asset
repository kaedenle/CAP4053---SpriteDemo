      words: Simple one strikes won't do against the next jumps.
    - speaker: 7
      words: You can chain certain moves together when you hit an enemy. The basic
        idea is to chain quicker attacks into heavy hitting attacks.
    - speaker: 7
      words: This is chaining. It'll allow you to output large amounts of damage
        to enemy hordes.
    - speaker: 7
      words: 'Right click then left click in quick succession on that dummy behind
        you for an example. '
    - speaker: 7
      words: You'll notice you'll be able to attack much faster compared to doing
        the same sequence when hitting nothing.

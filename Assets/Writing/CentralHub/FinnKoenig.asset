      words: Nice to meet you, Mr. Koenig.
    - speaker: 11
      words: Oh please detective, call me Finn!
    - speaker: 0
      words: Alright Finn. Do you know why you were brought in today?
    - speaker: 11
      words: Yes I know. Patrick finally passed. The Dummkopf. Couldn't handle what
        it takes to rule over a company!
    - speaker: 0
      words: Even though he did have a heart attack, the police believe it was a
        murder and have pinned you as a suspect.
    - speaker: 0
      words: So, I have a few questions for you, if you don't mind.
    - speaker: 11
      words: Go right ahead, Mr. Detective.
    - speaker: 0
      words: It's my impression that you two were business rivals?
    - speaker: 11
      words: That is the truth. He owns the exchange down the street from my empire,
        Kaiser Industries!
    - speaker: 11
      words: His company is a joke. Everybody on Wall Street knows about the shady
        dealings he was conducting.
    - speaker: 11
      words: Could barely hide the embezzlement, the insider trading, his whole company,
        a "witz" I tell you.
    - speaker: 11
      words: Kept stealing investors away with his under the counter deals and promises
        he knows he couldn't keep.
    - speaker: 0
      words: So it's safe to assume you two had a poor relationship?
    - speaker: 11
      words: 'What kind of question is that? We hated each other! '
    - speaker: 11
      words: We were always competing, but I would never run an empire by breaking
        the rules. My mother raised me better than that!
    - speaker: 0
      words: Let me explain to you why I had you bring a personal item of yours.
    - speaker: 0
      words: Which seems to be a crown? See, I have had this ability since I was
        a chil-
    - speaker: 11
      words: Oh no need! I carry this around with me everywhere!
    - speaker: 11
      words: It's the crown I keep to remind myself that I am King Finn of Kaiser
        Industries!
    - speaker: 11
      words: As my father, Elias Koenig, always said, "Don't be the boss, be the
        king!"

    - speaker: 0
      words: Nice to meet you, Mr. Koenig.
    - speaker: 11
      words: Oh, please detective, call me Finn!
    - speaker: 0
      words: Alright Finn. Do you know why you were brought in today?
    - speaker: 11
      words: Yes, I know. Patrick finally passed. The Dummkopf. Couldn't handle what
        it takes to rule over a company!
    - speaker: 0
      words: Even though he did have a heart attack, the police believe it was a
        murder and have pinned you as a suspect.
    - speaker: 0
      words: So, I have a few questions for you, if you don't mind.
    - speaker: 11
      words: Go right ahead, Mr. Detective.
    - speaker: 0
      words: It's my impression that you two were business rivals?
    - speaker: 11
      words: That is the truth. He owns the exchange down the street from my empire,
        Kaiser Industries!
    - speaker: 11
      words: However, his company is a joke. Everybody on Wall Street knows about
        his shady business dealings.
    - speaker: 11
      words: All the embezzlement, the insider trading, etc. His whole company, a
        joke, I tell you!
    - speaker: 11
      words: Kept stealing my investors away with his under-the-counter deals and
        promises he knows he couldn't keep.
    - speaker: 0
      words: So it's safe to assume you two had a poor relationship?
    - speaker: 11
      words: 'What kind of question is that? We hated each other! '
    - speaker: 11
      words: We were always competing, but I would never run an empire by breaking
        the rules. My mother raised me better than that!
    - speaker: 0
      words: I see. Now, let me explain to you why I had you bring a personal item
        of yours.
    - speaker: 0
      words: Which seems to be a crown?
    - speaker: 11
      words: Yes! My crown! I carry it with me everywhere!
    - speaker: 11
      words: It reminds me of my status as king of Kaiser Industries!
    - speaker: 0
      words: ...
    - speaker: 0
      words: Right.
    - speaker: 0
      words: See, this personal item of yours is going to be used as somewhat of
        a, "catalyst", to enter your mind in order to conduct my investigation.
    - speaker: 0
      words: Understand?
    - speaker: 11
      words: Not even a little bit! But you americans are funny, so I'll let you
        do your fancy, "mind transfer".
    - speaker: 0
      words: Perfect. Let's begin.
  - dialogue:
    - speaker: 11
      words: Let's get started, shall we? Gotta get back to my empire!
